Do you want to get an arbitrary interpreter running on the glorious IPython infrastructure quickly? Then you've come to the right place!

I am a complete newbie to IPython, but I thought it would be fun to

at

https://github.com/dsblank/simple_kernel

If you want to learn some IPython internals, then dsblank's project is
a good place to start.
